In this homework assigment I had some trouble figuring out how to make the output to make the password work.  

On line 2 I added a order list that filled it with arrays with each of the letters of the alphabet in order for the function below to generate from that. 

From lines 15 to 43, I added lines of code with if statements and if else statements in order to have all of the required promts the pop up with the coresponding code. 

At the end of the code I could not figure out what exacly why my code was not working properly. I needed help with the final touches.
